# Master_thesis_project
This repository contains the Google Colab notebook which was used in my master thesis. The first part of this notebook implements proposition of a new dynamic classifier ensamble selection algorithm, which uses relearning technique. The second part compares it with four already existing algorithms from the DESlib library.
