# Master_thesis_project
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook which I used in my master thesis. The first part of this notebook implements a proposition of a new dynamic classifier ensamble selection algorithm, which uses relearning technique. The algorithm was named RES - Relearning Ensamble Selection algorithm. The second part performs a comparisons between the RES algorithm and four already existing algorithms from the DESlib library: KNORA-U, KNORA-E, META-DES and DESP.
